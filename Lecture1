******************* Introduction to C++ *************************
This lecture was all about importance of programming language, how does a computer calculates (like decimal to binary and vice-versa, etc.)
Programming language helps us to communicate with computer and solve problems using a computer.

*********************** Why learn C++ ******************
-> Efficiency - helps to solve problems faster
-> Strong Abstracton Policy - helps storing the data really well
-> Standard templte Library(STL) - asset of pre-defined data types
-> Best in Resourse Constraint Enviornment 
-> Strong Typing and Compile-Time Checks

****************** What is an IDE and Compiler **************
An IDE is a tool/software  which helps you to wrute the code more faster and efficiently, and helps to run the code faster.
A Compiler is something which converts high-level language to low-level language for the computer to understand and perform the tasks, calculations and programming.
***************** High level and Low level Languages *********************
High Level - can be understaood by humans and other intelligence species only.
Low Level - can be understood by computer.
